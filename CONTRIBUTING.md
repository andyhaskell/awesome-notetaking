# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request

- List items should be sorted *alphabetically* in order of the name, or username, of the author.
- Each item should be limited to one link.
- The link should be the title of the resource.
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark.

- This project has just started, so the categories are not yet set in stone
